### v3.0.0

- [2020.07.20] First stable release for the phpMussel-PHPMailer linker.

__*Why "v3.0.0" instead of "v1.0.0?"*__ Because the linker is intended for use with phpMussel v3, and development began at the same time as (and alongside), I've opted to start at *v3.0.0*, in order to avoid confusion with components intended for earlier versions of phpMussel, which have similar names and purpose.
